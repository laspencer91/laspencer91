## 🎯 What I Do

I'm a Tech Lead who still ships code daily. I specialize in team multiplying tools, and solving problems before people know they exist.

From real-time multiplayer frameworks to enterprise healthcare systems, from game engines to AI integrations—I will travel wherever I am needed.

```javascript
const logan = {
  role: "Tech Lead @ YouVersion",
  usersImpacted: "700M+",
  approach: "Ship first, philosophize later",
  superpower: "Making complex things simple",
  kryptonite: "Meetings about meetings"
} as const;

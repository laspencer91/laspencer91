## 🎯 What I Do

I'm a Tech Lead who still ships code daily. I specialize in transforming "that's impossible" into "here's the PR." 

From real-time multiplayer frameworks to enterprise healthcare systems, from game engines to AI integrations—I navigate the territories others won't touch.

```javascript
const logan = {
  role: "Tech Lead @ YouVersion",
  usersImpacted: "700M+",
  approach: "Ship first, philosophize later",
  superpower: "Making complex things simple",
  kryptonite: "Meetings about meetings"
} as const;
